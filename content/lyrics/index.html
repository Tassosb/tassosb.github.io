        Pacing like a dog<br />
        Am I older now?<br />
        Am I watered down?<br />
        You don’t tell me what you don’t tell<br />
        <br />
        Waiting by the door<br />
        Watch the world go by<br />
        Through your amber eyes<br />
        You don’t tell me what you don’t tell<br />
        <br />
        You are one special friend<br />
        I’ll be around til the end<br />
        What I like about you<br />
        You’ve got whiskers on your nose<br />
        You don’t know what you don’t know<br />
        <br />
        Running in a dream<br />
        Am I lost or found?<br />
        Am I on the ground?<br />
        You don’t tell me what you don’t tell<br />
        <br />
        Jumping on the bed<br />
        Wagging your long tail<br />
        Raising wake-up hell<br />
        You don’t tell me what you don’t tell<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        You are one special friend<br />
        I’ll be around til the end<br />
        What I like about you<br />
        You’ve got whiskers on your nose<br />
        You don’t know what you don’t know<br />
        <br />
        Dogs have souls<br />
        Souls have dreams<br />
        Dreams give us hope<br />
        Hope gives us life<br />
        Life has an end<br />
        That’s why we love<br />
        Love is the feeling I feel for my dog<br />
        <br />
        Dogs have souls<br />
        Souls have dreams<br />
        Dreams give us hope<br />
        Hope gives us life<br />
        Life has an end<br />
        That’s why we love<br />
        Love is the feeling I feel for my dog<br />
        <br />
        Curled up on a chair<br />
        Am I older now?<br />
        Am I watered down?<br />
        You don’t tell me what you don’t tell<br />

        I traded oak for coyote willow<br />
        I traded the sea for a river going dry<br />
        Here when it rains you’re always wanting more<br />
        Here when it snows you cry<br />
        <br />
        There are a lot of crows in this town<br />
        They come in the winter and leave in the spring<br />
        I haven’t found a crow that’ll look me in the eye<br />
        But I hear there’s such a thing<br />
        <br />
        We talked on the phone in early April<br />
        You called in the middle of the night<br />
        Told me drinking’s got you feeling underwater<br />
        Might give sobriety a try<br />
        <br />
        I’ve been writing a postcard<br />
        I’m thinking of sending to you<br />
        There’s a house on a hill on the back side<br />
        With a truck in the yard and a view<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Not much happens here on the weekends<br />
        No city lights shine on your smile<br />
        Saint Valentine plays piano on Sundays<br />
        Ann says you can stay a while<br />
        <br />
        Time passes with the seasons<br />
        The summer rains dry up by fall<br />
        I miss you every time I look out the window<br />
        I want you to have it all<br />
        <br />
        I’ve been writing a postcard<br />
